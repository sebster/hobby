To imagine is to represent without aiming at things as they actually, presently, and subjectively are. One can use imagination to represent possibilities other than the actual, to represent times other than the present, and to represent perspectives other than one&rsquo;s own. Unlike perceiving and believing, imagining something does not require one to consider that something to be the case.
